HiðŸ‘‹

I'm working at [yagom-academy](https://github.com/yagom-academy)

I love code, especially Swift. It helps me to communicate with people and world!ðŸ˜„ I also like having time to watch comic or hear rock. I like talking about ways how to improve the U.X. and codes. And now, I'm interested in test. So I'm trying to write codes to testable.

These days, my hobby is to solve problems in [baekjoon](https://www.acmicpc.net/)

I always imagine myself that I would be a better person than yesterday's me. So I'm trying to know one each day. (But, as you know... It is hard to do)


If I had to know something, I studied super hard and put a lot of effortsðŸ”¥, until I could teach someone.

I'm not good at English. so if you find some wrong words or awkward sentences, please point it outðŸ˜„
