HiðŸ‘‹

I'm an iOS developer, especially engineer! I like talking about ways how to improvement the U.X. and codes.

I always imagine myself that I would be a better person than yesterday's me. So I'm trying to know one each day.
(But, you know... It is hard to do. So, like many ordinary people, sometimes I have a time to refresh watching comic or hearing rock)

I love code, especially Swift. It helps me to communicate with people and world!ðŸ˜„

Now I'm starting to like test. So I'm trying to write codes to testable.

If I had to know something, I studied really really very hard and put a lot of effortsðŸ”¥, until I could teach someone.

I'm not good at English. so if you find some wrong words or awkward sentences, please point it outðŸ˜„
