HiðŸ‘‹

I love code, especially Swift. It helps me to communicate with people and world!ðŸ˜„ I also like having time to watch comic or hear rock. I like talking about ways how to improve the U.X. and codes. And now, I'm interested in test. So I'm trying to write codes to testable, and I do test it.

I always imagine myself that I would be a better person than yesterday's me. So I'm trying to know one each day. (But, as you know... It is hard to do)

If I had to know something, I studied super hard and put a lot of effortsðŸ”¥, until I could teach someone.

I'm not good at English. so if you find some wrong words or awkward sentences, please point it out
