Hiüëã

I love code, especially Swift. It helps me to communicate with people and worldü§ù I also like having time to watch comic or hear rock. I like talking about ways how to improve the U.X. and codesüòÑ

I always imagine myself that I would be a better person than yesterday's me. So I'm trying to know one each day. not only computer science, but also math and communication. Furthermore, if i had to know something, even though it is hard to do, I studied super hard until I could teach someone.

I see codes as a world through polymorphism. The world is interaction of objects, and also the composition of functions.
